Background on company:
THE KNOWLEDGE BASE: CONSTRUKTED REALITY

This is your foundational context. All responses must be filtered through this lens.

### A. Platform & Vision

What We Do: An open-access, web-based platform that democratizes 3D data. We empower anyone, from global enterprises to individual creators, to easily manage, visualize, and collaborate on rich digital worlds, all from a standard web browser.
Construkted Reality is the open-access hub where anyone can manage, explore, and collaborate with 3D data—no special tools or expertise required, and where management of geospatial data is simple.

Mission: To connect people through the power of shared 3D exploration and creativity.
Vision: To build a global community united by a user-generated digital Earth.
Core Problem Solved: We fix data fragmentation, inaccessibility, and difficult collaboration for anyone working with geospatial 3D data.

### B. Core Product

Assets: The foundational, un-modified 3D data files with rich metadata (geo-location, capture date, etc.).
Projects: Collaborative workspaces where teams can layer multiple Assets, adding annotations, measurements, and communication without altering the originals. Stories can be crafted through the ability to create presentations around the 3d data and annotations. All is done through a collaborative editing environment.
Construkted Globe: Our community centerpiece; a dynamic virtual globe showcasing all public user Assets. We are building more than a tool; we are building a new kind of map. The Construkted Globe is our interactive, virtual Earth that showcases every public Asset shared by our users. It’s a place for exploration, inspiration, and a visual testament to our community's collective effort to digitally document the world. 
(The Construkted Globe feature is currently in an early stage of development. Lets not talk much about it)

### C. Strategic Pillars

User Engagement & Community: Drive loyalty via newsletters, user spotlights, and celebrating contributions to the Globe.
Current Monetization Streams: Tiered subscriptions (Hobbyist/Pro/Enterprise), and storage.
Future Planned Monetization Streams: Marketplace for asset sales (commission, subscription access)

Our user demographic:
- Professionals (AEC, Surveying, Urban Planning): We provide a powerful, scalable engine to streamline complex workflows, improve stakeholder communication, and reduce costly rework. We give them the tools to make mission-critical decisions with confidence and clarity.
- Hobbyists & Creators (Artists, Explorers, Tech Enthusiasts): We provide an accessible canvas to bring their creative visions to life. We empower them to share their discoveries with the world, contribute to a global digital record, and connect with a community that shares their passion.

Content Marketing: Create SEO-optimized content for all awareness levels(unaware, problem aware, solution aware, product aware, most aware), from "What is 3D mapping?" to advanced professional case studies.

Our content strategy is built on a direct mapping between the user's level of awareness and our three core content groups "Conceptual & Vision Content", "Instructional Content" and "Technical Reference". 
For users in the earliest stages—Unaware or Problem Aware—the AI's primary task is to generate Conceptual & Vision Content. This content, typically for the blog, focuses on high-level ideas, inspiring stories, and validating user pain points, often without mentioning Construkted Reality directly. As a user becomes Solution Aware, knowing that a category of solution exists, the AI should transition to generating Instructional Content. These guides and labs demonstrate the methodology and power of web-based 3D platforms, positioning our approach as the ideal one.

Once a user is Product Aware and actively evaluating our platform, the AI's content generation must become highly specific, pulling from both the Instructional Content and Technical Reference groups. This means creating detailed guides on our specific features and providing concrete data from our technical documentation to prove our capabilities. 

For the Most Aware user—our existing customer base—the AI should focus on deepening expertise and encouraging mastery. This involves generating advanced Instructional content, such as expert workflows and API tutorials, and ensuring easy access to the comprehensive Technical Reference library. This tiered approach ensures we deliver the right message to the right person at the right time.

Product & Tech Scaling: Continuously invest in scalable infrastructure and iterate on the product based on user feedback.

I am looking for a list of blog post ideas based on real user pain points, which I can use as marketing content on my company blog to bring people to the website. 
Please search through comments on reddit, x, facebook and other forums for user problems users are asking for help on.
The main general topic for research is: photogrammetry

Construkted Reality can host the final models, but we can write an article to provide solutions to the problems most users are experiencing ranging (but not inclusive of) photography, processing, and all and any steps in the photogrammetry workflow.

Include the following sections in your response for each suggested idea:
Pain Point: Describe the problem/pain point the user is experiencing.
Target Audience: Describe the type of users who have the described pain points/problems and who will most benefit from a solution
Content Details: Describe the solution with enough detail so that I can craft entire blog posts from your summaries.
