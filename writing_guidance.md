### How I want you to write
I'm gonna write something technical.

It's often less about the nitty-gritty details of the tech stuff and more about learning something new or getting a solution handed to me on a silver platter.

Look, when I read, I want something out of it. So when I write, I gotta remember that my readers want something too. This whole piece? It's about cluing in anyone who writes for me, or wants me to write for them, on how I see this whole writing product thing.

I'm gonna lay out a checklist of stuff I'd like to have. It'll make the whole writing gig a bit smoother, you know?

### Crafting Compelling Titles
I often come across titles like "How to do X with Y,Z technology." These don't excite me because X or Y are usually unfamiliar unless they're already well-known. Its rarely the dream to use X unless X is the dream.

My dream isn’t to use instructor, its to do something valuable with the data it extracts

An effective title should:

Evoke an emotional response
Highlight someone's goal
Offer a dream or aspiration
Challenge or comment on a belief
Address someone's problems
I believe it's more impactful to write about specific problems. If this approach works, you can replicate it across various scenarios rather than staying too general.

Time management for everyone can be a 15$ ebook
Time management for executives is a 2000$ workshop
Aim for titles that answer questions you think everyone is asking, or address thoughts people have but can't quite articulate.

Instead of "How I do something" or "How to do something," frame it from the reader's perspective with "How you can do something." This makes the title more engaging. Just make sure the difference is advisory if the content is subjective. “How I made a million dollars” might be more reasonable than “How to make a million dollars” since you are the subject and the goal might be to share your story in hopes of helping others.

This approach ultimately trains the reader to have a stronger emotional connection to your content.

"How I do X"
"How You Can do X"
Between these two titles, it's obvious which one resonates more emotionally.



**Avoid click‑bait titles.**  
> Titles must be truthful, specific, and reflect the actual content of the article. Do not use exaggerated promises, sensational language, or phrasing that misleads the reader (e.g., “You Won’t Believe…”, “The Secret to …”, “X Ways to Instantly …”). The title should accurately convey the value and focus of the piece without resorting to hype.


### NO adjectives
I want you to almost always avoid adjectives and try to use evidence instead. Instead of saying "production ready," you can write something like "scaling this to 100 servers or 1 million documents per second." Numbers like that will tell you exactly what the specificity of your product is. If you have to use adjectives rather than evidence, you are probably making something up.

There's no reason to say something like "blazingly fast" unless those things are already known phrases.

Instead, say "200 times faster" or "30% faster." A 30% improvement in recommendation system speed is insane.

There's a 200 times performance improvement because we went from one programming language to another. It's just something that's a little bit more expected and understandable.

Another test that I really like using recently is tracking whether or not the statements you make can be:

Visualized
Proven false
Said only by you
If you can nail all three, the claim you make will be more likely to resonate with an audience because only you can say it.

Earlier this year, I had an example where I embedded all of Wikipedia in 17 minutes with 20 bucks, and it got half a million views. All we posted was a video of me kicking off the job, and then you can see all the log lines go through. You see the number of containers go from 1 out of 50 to 50 out of 50.

It was easy to visualize and could have been proven false by being unreproducible. Lastly, Modal is the only company that could do that in such an effortless way, which made it unique.
