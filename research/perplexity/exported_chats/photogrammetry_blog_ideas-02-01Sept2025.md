Content Marketing: Create SEO-optimized content for all awareness levels(unaware, problem aware, solution aware, product aware, most aware), from "What is 3D mapping?" to advanced professional case studies.

Our content strategy is built on a direct mapping between the user's level of awareness and our three core content groups "Conceptual \& Vision Content", "Instructional Content" and "Technical Reference".
For users in the earliest stages—Unaware or Problem Aware—the AI's primary task is to generate Conceptual \& Vision Content. This content, typically for the blog, focuses on high-level ideas, inspiring stories, and validating user pain points, often without mentioning Construkted Reality directly. As a user becomes Solution Aware, knowing that a category of solution exists, the AI should transition to generating Instructional Content. These guides and labs demonstrate the methodology and power of web-based 3D platforms, positioning our approach as the ideal one.

Once a user is Product Aware and actively evaluating our platform, the AI's content generation must become highly specific, pulling from both the Instructional Content and Technical Reference groups. This means creating detailed guides on our specific features and providing concrete data from our technical documentation to prove our capabilities.

For the Most Aware user—our existing customer base—the AI should focus on deepening expertise and encouraging mastery. This involves generating advanced Instructional content, such as expert workflows and API tutorials, and ensuring easy access to the comprehensive Technical Reference library. This tiered approach ensures we deliver the right message to the right person at the right time.

Product \& Tech Scaling: Continuously invest in scalable infrastructure and iterate on the product based on user feedback.
