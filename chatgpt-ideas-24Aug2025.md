10. **"Choose the Right Tool: ArcGIS vs. QGIS vs. Construkted"**

* **Pain Point**: Users struggle picking between ArcGIS, QGIS, custom tools; each has pros/cons (licensing, language, platform) ([Geeky Mappy Geoyi][9]).
* **How-To**: Comparison table focusing on web-native workflows, easy sharing, no setup.

11. **"Simple Strategies for Standardizing Geodata Formats"**

* **Pain Point**: Format mismatch—Addr vs Address, projections, KML vs GeoJSON vs other formats ([Medium][2]).
* **How-To**: Best practices for ingestion and normalization in Construkted asset workflows.

12. **"3D Mapping Without the Pink Screens: Formatting for Compatibility"**

* **Pain Point**: Users get flat or distorted models (e.g. wrong elevation) ([Reddit][10]).
* **How-To**: Show correct alignment, elevation handling, labels in 3D.

13. **"Data Accuracy: The Hidden Value of Geo-Metadata"**

* **Pain Point**: Outdated or inaccurate data misleads decisions ([Medium][2]).
* **How-To**: Demonstrate using metadata (capture date, geolocation) to drive decisions.

14. **"Building a Web-Based 3D Portfolio (No Code Needed)"**

* **Opportunity**: Fills the gap of sharing maps publicly like a portfolio ([Reddit][4]).
* **How-To**: Show hobbyists how to create and embed 3D viewlets, share to blog or social media.
