# Building the 3D Dream Team: Assembling Skills for Modern Geospatial Workflows

**Content Direction**: Define role requirements for modern 3D teams, provide hiring and training guidance for building 3D capabilities, and address the skills gap between traditional surveying/GIS roles and current technology demands.

**User Pain Point**: Organizations struggle to build teams with the right mix of technical and communication skills for complex 3D projects. Traditional role definitions don't match modern 3D workflow requirements.
