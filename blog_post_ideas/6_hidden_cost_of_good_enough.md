# The Hidden Cost of 'Good Enough' 3D Visualization: When Beautiful Renders Lead to Construction Disasters

**Pain Point**: Architects and construction professionals report that stunning 3D visualizations often fail to reflect real-world buildability, leading to costly construction errors and client disappointment when built results don't match renders. Many visualizations feature "impossible details" that look great but can't be executed.

**Description**: Examine the gap between visualization aesthetics and construction reality, provide guidelines for creating buildable 3D visualizations, and share stories of projects that avoided costly mistakes through accurate 3D modeling. Include case studies of projects that improved buildability.
