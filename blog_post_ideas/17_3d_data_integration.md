# 3D Data Integration: Connecting Siloed Systems for a Unified View

**Pain Point**: Data silos prevent organizations from creating comprehensive 3D models that incorporate information from multiple systems. Teams struggle to integrate data from CAD, GIS, BIM, and other sources into cohesive 3D representations.

**Description**: Provide practical integration strategies for connecting disparate data sources into unified 3D models. Demonstrate how to create seamless data pipelines that combine CAD, GIS, BIM, and other data types for comprehensive 3D visualization.
