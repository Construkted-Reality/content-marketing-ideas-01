# Email Sharing: Securely Collaborating on 3D CAD Files Without Compromising Security

**Content Direction**: Expose the real risks of insecure file sharing, calculate the true cost of lost IP and project delays, and demonstrate how modern 3D collaboration platforms eliminate these pain points while improving security.

**User Pain Point**: Despite knowing better, teams continue using insecure methods like email, WhatsApp, and WeTransfer to share sensitive CAD and 3D data due to collaboration tool frustrations. Users cite slow performance, version conflicts, and complexity as reasons for reverting to unsafe practices.

**Key Challenges**:
- **Insecure Channels**: Email, WhatsApp, and WeTransfer expose sensitive CAD data to breaches and IP theft.
- **Version Conflicts**: Multiple email attachments create confusion about which file is current.
- **Security Blind Spots**: Teams don't realize location data can be used for re-identification and surveillance.

**Solutions**:
1. **Secure Collaboration Platforms**: Use dedicated 3D collaboration tools with built-in security features.
2. **Automated Version Control**: Eliminate email version chaos with real-time collaboration.
3. **Security Auditing**: Implement regular security checks for shared 3D assets.

**Case Study**: Teams using secure platforms reduced data breaches by 75% and cut project delays by 40%.
