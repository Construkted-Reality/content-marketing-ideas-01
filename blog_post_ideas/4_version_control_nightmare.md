# Version Control Nightmare: When Multiple Teams Edit the Same 3D Model

**Pain Point**: Teams working on collaborative 3D projects face constant version conflicts, with users reporting data loss, overwrites, and confusion about which files are current. Traditional file-based workflows fail when multiple people need to edit simultaneously.

**Description**: Explore real-time collaboration challenges in 3D workflows, compare different version control approaches, and demonstrate how modern platforms handle concurrent editing without conflicts. Focus on conflict resolution, version history, and share control in collaborative environments.
