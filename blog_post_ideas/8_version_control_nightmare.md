# The Version Control Nightmare: When Multiple Teams Edit the Same 3D Model

**Content Direction**: Explore real-time collaboration challenges in 3D workflows, compare different version control approaches, and demonstrate how modern platforms handle concurrent editing without conflicts.

**User Pain Point**: Teams working on collaborative 3D projects face constant version conflicts, with users reporting data loss, overwrites, and confusion about which files are current. Traditional file-based workflows fail when multiple people need to edit simultaneously.
