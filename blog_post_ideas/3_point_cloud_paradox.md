# The Point Cloud Paradox: Why Your Expensive 3D Scans Are Gathering Digital Dust

**Pain Point**: Organizations invest heavily in 3D scanning and point cloud data but struggle with huge file sizes, slow performance, and difficulty extracting actionable insights. Users report point cloud files "really bog down the models" and are "5x more labor intensive to create a 3D model from."

**Description**: Address common point cloud processing challenges, show how to optimize workflows for better performance, and demonstrate techniques for turning raw scan data into valuable project assets. Cover PDAL, LAStools, Entwine, Potree, and browser-based optimization.
