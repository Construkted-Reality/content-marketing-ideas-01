# Breaking Free from Data Silos: Why Your 3D Projects Are Drowning in Fragmented Information

**Pain Point**: Professionals across AEC and surveying industries struggle with fragmented information across multiple platforms, leading to version control nightmares and delayed decision-making. GIS professionals also report siloed datasets across departments (planning, utilities, emergency mapping), resulting in mismatched information and communication disconnects.

**Description**: Explore how data fragmentation occurs in 3D workflows, showcase real-world cost impacts, and demonstrate how centralized 3D data management transforms collaboration. Include case studies of teams who eliminated information silos and reduced project timelines by 30%. Unify data layers in one shared workspace to prevent silos and improve team alignment.
