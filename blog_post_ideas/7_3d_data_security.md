# 3D Data Security: Why Your Models Are a Security Time Bomb

**Pain Point**: Organizations share sensitive 3D and geospatial data through unsecured channels, unaware of privacy risks and potential for data breaches. Users don't realize that location data can be used for re-identification and surveillance.

**Description**: Educate about specific security risks in 3D data sharing, provide security auditing checklists, and demonstrate how proper data governance protects both projects and privacy. Cover ethical sharing practices, anonymization techniques, and permission management.
