# The Accuracy Paradox: When Precise 3D Data Leads to Imprecise Decisions

**Pain Point**: Organizations assume that more detailed 3D data automatically leads to better decisions, but users report being overwhelmed by precision without context. Accurate data doesn't guarantee accurate interpretation.

**Description**: Explore the relationship between data precision and decision quality, provide frameworks for appropriate levels of detail, and show how to present 3D data in decision-friendly formats. Include case studies where precision improved decision-making.
