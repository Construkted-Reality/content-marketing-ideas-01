**3D Data Governance: Who Owns What in Your Digital World?**  
*Establishing clear frameworks, ready‑to‑use policies, and conflict‑resolution tactics for collaborative 3‑D projects.*

### Why 3‑D Data Governance matters now more than ever  

The explosion of point‑cloud scans, BIM models, photogrammetric meshes, and satellite‑derived terrain tiles has turned 3‑D data into the new “currency” of architecture, infrastructure, and immersive media. Yet, as **Forbes** recently highlighted, *“data management poses major challenges and issues for companies”*—from siloed ownership to ambiguous usage rights. In the 3‑D realm those challenges become tangible:

| Pain point | Real‑world symptom | Source insight |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Unclear ownership** | Teams argue over who can edit, share, or monetize a city‑scale mesh. | Forbes notes “lack of clear data ownership” fuels disputes and compliance risk. |
| **Fragmented access control** | Engineers can’t send CAD files via email because security filters block them, forcing clunky work‑arounds. | CADChain reports “why can’t I send my CAD files through email?” – a symptom of unmanaged file policies. |
| **Security & compliance risk** | Sensitive site‑survey data leaks when anyone on a shared drive can download it. | Forbes: “data breaches often stem from poorly defined access rights.” |
| **Project delays** | Multiple stakeholders wait for “permission to use” a LiDAR asset, stalling design reviews. | CADChain: “lack of a single source of truth slows collaboration.” |

If your organization is wrestling with any of these, you’re not alone—most 3‑D teams operate without a formal governance playbook. The result? Conflict, re‑work, and lost value.

## A 3‑D Governance Framework that works for every team  

Below is a **four‑layer framework** that maps directly to the way Construkted Reality structures its data (Assets → Projects → Stories). You can adopt it as‑is, or adapt it to any existing file‑server or cloud‑storage solution.

| Layer | What it governs | Core questions | Typical owners |
|-------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **1️⃣ Asset Registry** | The immutable, source‑level 3‑D files (point clouds, CAD, OBJ, GeoTIFF) and their metadata. | • Who created the asset?<br>• What is the source (drone, survey, vendor)?<br>• Are there licensing or export restrictions? | Data creator, Asset Manager, Legal |
| **2️⃣ Project Workspace** | Collaborative “sandboxes” where teams layer annotations, measurements, and derived models without altering the original asset. | • Who can add/modify annotations?<br>• Who can export derived models?<br>• What version‑control rules apply? | Project Lead, Discipline Leads |
| **3️⃣ Story & Publication** | Public‑facing presentations, dashboards, or marketplace listings built on top of a Project. | • Who may publish or share externally?<br>• What attribution or revenue‑share rules exist?<br>• Is the story open‑access or gated? | Content Owner, Marketing, Legal |
| **4️⃣ Governance Board** | Organization‑wide policies that tie the three layers together (audit, compliance, revocation). | • How are disputes escalated?<br>• What is the review cadence?<br>• How are policy breaches remediated? | CDO / Data Governance Committee |

> **Why this works:** The layers keep *original data* pristine (Asset Registry), while still allowing fluid collaboration (Project Workspace) and controlled outreach (Story). Governance rules sit on top, providing a single point of authority without choking creativity.

## Ready‑to‑Use Templates

### 1️⃣ 3‑D Asset Usage Policy (Template)

```
Title: 3‑D Asset Usage Policy – [Company/Project Name]

1. Scope
   • Applies to all raw 3‑D assets stored in the Construkted Reality Asset Library.

2. Ownership
   • Creator = Primary Owner (e.g., Survey Team, Vendor X)
   • Co‑Owner rights granted by written agreement.

3. Access Levels
   • Viewer – read‑only, can download low‑res previews.
   • Contributor – can add annotations in Project Workspace.
   • Exporter – may download full‑resolution assets for downstream work.

4. Licensing & Redistribution
   • Internal use only unless a separate commercial license is attached.
   • External sharing requires Legal sign‑off and attribution clause.

5. Retention & Archiving
   • Assets older than 5 years moved to “Cold Storage” after a review.
   • Deletion requires two‑person approval and audit log.

6. Security
   • All assets encrypted at rest.
   • MFA required for Exporter role.

7. Review Cycle
   • Quarterly governance board meeting to audit roles and usage logs.

Signature: _____________________   Date: _______________
```

*Plug this into your Construkted Reality “Asset” metadata fields to auto‑populate role‑based permissions.*

### 2️⃣ Project Collaboration Charter (Template)

| Section | Example Content |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Project Name** | “Downtown Revitalization – Phase 2” |
| **Goal** | Deliver a BIM‑ready 3‑D model of the historic district within 90 days. |
| **Stakeholders** | • Urban Planning Lead (Owner)<br>• Survey Team (Data Provider)<br>• Architecture Firm (Designer) |
| **Roles & Permissions** | • **Owner** – full edit & export rights.<br>• **Contributor** – annotation, measurement, version comments.<br>• **Viewer** – read‑only, no export. |
| **Decision‑Making** | All export requests routed through Project Owner; escalations to Governance Board after 48 h. |
| **Conflict Resolution** | First‑line: Project Owner.<br>Second‑line: Data Governance Board (within 5 business days). |
| **Data Retention** | Keep final model for 7 years; intermediate versions archived after project close. |

Upload this charter as a **Project “Story”** in Construkted Reality; the platform will enforce the listed permissions automatically.

### 3️⃣ Ownership‑Conflict Resolution Flowchart (One‑page visual)

1. **Identify conflict** → 2. **Log ticket in Governance Board portal** → 3. **Check Asset Registry for declared owner** →  
4a. **Owner authorizes** → Grant / deny permission → End.  
4b. **No clear owner** → Invoke “Shared‑Creator” policy (equal split, revenue‑share) → End.  

*(Create the diagram in any vector tool and embed it in your internal wiki.)*

## Common 3‑D Governance Scenarios & How to Defuse Them  

| Scenario | What typically goes wrong | Governance fix (using the framework) |
|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **A. “I need the raw point‑cloud for analysis, but the file is blocked by email security.”** | Teams resort to insecure file‑sharing services. | Store the asset in Construkted Reality, assign the requester the **Exporter** role, and let them download via a secure HTTPS link (audit‑logged). |
| **B. “Our client wants the model, but we’re not sure if we can sell it.”** | Legal and design teams clash over licensing. | Attach a **License Metadata Tag** to the Asset (e.g., “Commercial‑Allowed – 3 yr”). The Governance Board validates before any **Story** is published. |
| **C. “Two engineers edited the same mesh in different projects; we now have version drift.”** | No single source of truth → re‑work. | Enforce **read‑only** on Asset layer; all edits happen only in **Project Workspaces**, which keep separate version histories that can be merged back to the master asset. |
| **D. “A subcontractor left the project; we still have their annotations.”** | Orphaned data creates security risk. | Governance Board auto‑revokes all roles linked to a user after a 30‑day de‑provision window, and archives their annotations for audit. |

## Take the first step today  

1. **Audit your current 3‑D assets** – Export a list of files, owners, and current access rights.  
2. **Map them to the Asset Registry** – Use Construkted Reality’s bulk‑import to tag each file with creator, source, and license.  
3. **Roll out a Project Collaboration Charter** – Pick one active project, paste the template, and assign roles.  
4. **Schedule a Governance Board meeting** – Review the first quarter’s audit logs and resolve any open conflicts.

When you align your 3‑D data with a clear governance structure, you unlock:

- Faster design cycles (no “who can I share this with?” delays)  
- Lower security risk (audit‑ready logs)  
- New revenue streams (confidently monetize assets knowing ownership is crystal clear)  

**Your digital world is only as trustworthy as the rules that govern it.** Let’s make those rules simple, transparent, and built for collaboration.
