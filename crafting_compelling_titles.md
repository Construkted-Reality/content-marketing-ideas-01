# TITLE GUIDELINES
- Write the title **from the reader’s point of view**.  
  Use “How you can …”, “What you need to …”, or “Why you should …”.  
  Do NOT use “How I …” unless the article is strictly a personal case study.

- Include **one concrete benefit or goal** the reader will achieve.  
  Example: “Reduce query latency by 40 % in under 5 minutes”.

- If possible, keep the title word count under 15 words.

- Keep the title **truthful and specific**.  
  • No click‑bait phrasing (e.g., “You won’t believe…”, “The secret to…”).  
  • Do not promise results that the article does not deliver.

- Optional: add a **target audience or constraint** to increase relevance.  
  Example: “Deploy a CI pipeline for data‑science teams in 10 minutes”.

# TITLE FORMULA (use when applicable)
[Action] + [Target audience or context] + [Quantifiable outcome]  
e.g. “How you can deploy a Kubernetes cluster for SaaS teams in 7 minutes”.

# EXAMPLES
Good Example: “How you can reduce batch‑job runtime by 30 % on a single node”  
Bad Example: “How to make your app blazingly fast”
