# 3D Data Governance: Who Owns What in Your Digital World?  
*Establishing clear frameworks, ready‑to‑use policies, and conflict‑resolution tactics for collaborative 3‑D projects.*

## Why 3‑D Data Governance Matters More Than Ever  

The surge of point‑cloud scans, BIM models, photogrammetric meshes, and satellite‑derived terrain tiles has turned 3‑D data into the new **currency** of architecture, infrastructure, and immersive media. As **Forbes** recently warned, *“data management poses major challenges and issues for companies”*—from siloed ownership to ambiguous usage rights. In the 3‑D realm those challenges become **tangible, visual, and costly**.

| Pain point | What it looks like on the ground |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| **Unclear ownership** | Teams argue over who can edit, share, or monetize a city‑scale mesh. |
| **Fragmented access control** | Engineers can’t email CAD files because security filters block them, forcing clunky work‑arounds. |
| **Security & compliance risk** | Sensitive site‑survey data leaks when anyone on a shared drive can download it. |
| **Project delays** | Multiple stakeholders wait for “permission to use” a LiDAR asset, stalling design reviews. |

If any of these sound familiar, you’re not alone. Most 3‑D teams operate without a formal governance playbook, which translates into **conflict, re‑work, and lost value**.

## A 4‑Layer Governance Framework That Works for Every Team  

Construkted Reality already organizes data into **Assets → Projects → Stories**. The framework below maps directly onto those layers, giving you a ready‑made governance skeleton that can be adopted *as‑is* or tweaked to fit any file‑server or cloud storage solution.

| Layer | What it governs | Core questions | Typical owners |
|-------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **1️⃣ Asset Registry** | Immutable source files (point clouds, CAD, OBJ, GeoTIFF) + rich metadata | Who created the asset? What is the source? Are there licensing restrictions? | Data creator, Asset Manager, Legal |
| **2️⃣ Project Workspace** | Collaborative sandboxes where teams add annotations, measurements, and derived models **without altering the original** | Who can add/modify annotations? Who can export derived models? What version‑control rules apply? | Project Lead, Discipline Leads |
| **3️⃣ Story & Publication** | Public‑facing presentations, dashboards, or marketplace listings built on top of a Project | Who may publish externally? What attribution or revenue‑share rules exist? Is the story open‑access or gated? | Content Owner, Marketing, Legal |
| **4️⃣ Governance Board** | Organization‑wide policies that tie the three layers together (audit, compliance, revocation) | How are disputes escalated? What is the review cadence? How are policy breaches remediated? | CDO / Data Governance Committee |

**Why this works:**  
- *Original data stays pristine* (Asset Registry).  
- *Collaboration stays fluid* (Project Workspace).  
- *External sharing stays controlled* (Story).  
- *Oversight stays centralized* (Governance Board).

## Ready‑to‑Use Templates (Plug‑and‑Play)

### 1️⃣ 3‑D Asset Usage Policy (Template)

```
Title: 3‑D Asset Usage Policy – [Company/Project Name]

1. Scope
   • Applies to all raw 3‑D assets stored in the Construkted Reality Asset Library.

2. Ownership
   • Creator = Primary Owner (e.g., Survey Team, Vendor X)
   • Co‑Owner rights granted by written agreement.

3. Access Levels
   • Viewer – read‑only, can download low‑res previews.
   • Contributor – can add annotations in Project Workspace.
   • Exporter – may download full‑resolution assets for downstream work.

4. Licensing & Redistribution
   • Internal use only unless a separate commercial license is attached.
   • External sharing requires Legal sign‑off and attribution clause.

5. Retention & Archiving
   • Assets older than 5 years moved to “Cold Storage” after a review.
   • Deletion requires two‑person approval and audit log.

6. Security
   • All assets encrypted at rest.
   • MFA required for Exporter role.

7. Review Cycle
   • Quarterly governance board meeting to audit roles and usage logs.

Signature: _____________________   Date: ____________
```

*Upload this template as a metadata field on each Asset in Construkted Reality. The platform will automatically enforce the listed roles.*

> **Image Prompt:** “A stylized policy document on a digital tablet, with check‑boxes and icons for Viewer, Contributor, Exporter, over a faint 3‑D point‑cloud background.”  

### 2️⃣ Project Collaboration Charter (Template)

| Section | Example Content |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Project Name** | “Downtown Revitalization – Phase 2” |
| **Goal** | Deliver a BIM‑ready 3‑D model of the historic district within 90 days. |
| **Stakeholders** | • Urban Planning Lead (Owner) • Survey Team (Data Provider) • Architecture Firm (Designer) |
| **Roles & Permissions** | • **Owner** – full edit & export rights.<br>• **Contributor** – annotation, measurement, version comments.<br>• **Viewer** – read‑only, no export. |
| **Decision‑Making** | All export requests routed through Project Owner; escalations to Governance Board after 48 h. |
| **Conflict Resolution** | First‑line: Project Owner.<br>Second‑line: Data Governance Board (within 5 business days). |
| **Data Retention** | Keep final model for 7 years; intermediate versions archived after project close. |

Create a new **Story** in Construkted Reality, paste the charter, and the platform will lock the permissions accordingly.

> **Image Prompt:** “A collaborative web interface showing a project dashboard with role icons (owner, contributor, viewer) and a side panel displaying the Project Collaboration Charter text.”  

### 3️⃣ Ownership‑Conflict Resolution Flowchart (One‑Page Visual)

1. **Identify conflict** → 2. **Log ticket in Governance Board portal** → 3. **Check Asset Registry for declared owner** →  
4a. **Owner authorizes** → Grant / deny permission → End.  
4b. **No clear owner** → Invoke “Shared‑Creator” policy (equal split, revenue‑share) → End.

> **Image Prompt:** “A sleek flowchart with four steps, using bright accent colors, showing a ticket icon, a database icon, a person icon, and a handshake icon for shared‑creator resolution.”

## Real‑World Governance Scenarios & How to Defuse Them  

| Scenario | What typically goes wrong | Governance fix (using the framework) |
|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **A. “I need the raw point‑cloud, but email security blocks it.”** | Teams resort to insecure file‑sharing services. | Store the asset in Construkted Reality, assign the requester the **Exporter** role, and let them download via a secure HTTPS link (audit‑logged). |
| **B. “Our client wants the model, but we’re not sure we can sell it.”** | Legal and design teams clash over licensing. | Attach a **License Metadata Tag** to the Asset (e.g., “Commercial‑Allowed – 3 yr”). The Governance Board validates before any **Story** is published. |
| **C. “Two engineers edited the same mesh in different projects; we now have version drift.”** | No single source of truth → re‑work. | Enforce **read‑only** on Asset layer; all edits happen only in **Project Workspaces**, which keep separate version histories that can be merged back to the master asset. |
| **D. “A subcontractor left the project; we still have their annotations.”** | Orphaned data creates security risk. | Governance Board auto‑revokes all roles linked to a user after a 30‑day de‑provision window, and archives their annotations for audit. |

> **Image Prompt:** “Four comic‑style panels illustrating each scenario: blocked email, legal contract, version clash, and revoked user, each with a check‑mark overlay representing the governance fix.”
