# The Hidden Cost of 'Good Enough' 3D Visualization: When Beautiful Renders Lead to Construction Disasters

**Content Direction**: Examine the gap between visualization aesthetics and construction reality, provide guidelines for creating buildable 3D visualizations, and share stories of projects that avoided costly mistakes through accurate 3D modeling.

**User Pain Point**: Architects and construction professionals report that stunning 3D visualizations often fail to reflect real-world buildability, leading to costly construction errors and client disappointment when built results don't match renders. Many visualizations feature "impossible details" that look great but can't be executed.
